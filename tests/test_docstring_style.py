"""Guards on the notation docstrings are written in.

mkdocstrings renders a docstring as Markdown and has no reStructuredText reader, so a Sphinx
cross-reference role reaches the published page as literal text rather than as a link. Ruff has no
rule for it and the docs build does not fail on it, because an unrendered role is not a broken
link, just ugly prose. These tests are what notices.

Write a cross-reference the way mkdocstrings reads one: ``[`SetOffset`][qprogram_qdac.SetOffset]``
for a target this site documents, ``[`Expression`][qprogram.Expression]`` for one carried by the
core DSL's published inventory, and plain ``` `Expression` ``` for anything else, such as a
builtin, a stdlib name, or a helper no page renders.
